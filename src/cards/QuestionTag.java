	//I have no idea how we should do this.a
		//IDEAS:
		/*Should we separate it into large categorys like racial, sexual, etc.?
		 * Should we have some way to have subcategorys?
		 * Or should the tags just be like RACIAL_BLACK
		 * I have no idea about any of this these are just ideas
		 * 
		 * Should they include things like EVENT_TRAGIC (this would be applied to famous events like 9/11), 
		 * CELEBRETY_ENTERTAINMENT_MOVIES, CELEBRETY_POLITICAL_CONSERVATIVE, CELEBRITY_HISTORICAL_RUTHLESSDICTATOR,etc.
		 * 
		 * Or should there be a class, subject that contains multiple enums that represent the subject of the card? For example if
		 * the card was about a person it could say if the person was a man or a woman, etc because that might affect the demographic 
		 * that likes the card
		 * 
		 * NOTE: There is no inheritance with enums
		 * NOTE: Enums are written as follows
		 * RACIAL, <-------- All caps, then comma
		 * ...... <--------- These would be more options
		 * ...... <------------------|
		 * ...... <------------------|
		 * ...... <------------------|
		 * ...... <------------------+
		 * SDFDSFDS; <---------END THE ENUM WITH A SEMICOLON

		//Another idea - consolodate the AnswerTag and QuestionTag into one enum that would contain all of them.
